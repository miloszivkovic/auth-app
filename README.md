Small web app written using Java servlets.

Started as me helping out my friend get familiar with web development, but his requirement is that we do it by using servlets. I had no prior experience with it whatsoever so I had to learn it myself as well.

Got kinda hooked in with this old ass approach to writing web apps and I wanted to see how it was done before we had more modern tools wrapping around this.
